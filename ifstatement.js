var choosing = Math.floor(Math.random() * 4)  //Chooses a number between 0-4
// checks if choosing is equal to 0, then tells the user that
if(choosing == 0){
  alert("Your number is 0")
}
//we follow this logic 4 more times.
if(choosing == 1){
  alert("Your number is 1")
}
if(choosing == 2){
 alert("Your number is 2") 
}
if(choosing == 3){
 alert("Your number is 3") 
}
if(choosing == 4) {
  alert("Your number is 4")
}
//And that's how you make a random number generator using if statements and variables!
